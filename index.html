    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <section class="bubble">
        <p>Hello fellow Code Fellows! My name is Benjamin Carter, but you can call me Ben. I am super excited to be
            here
            with you all. I don't have a college degree to my name, but I've always found that as long as I am
            continuously
            learning, it has not been a hindrance for me. I've spent the last 7 years in IT support in one way or
            another.
            Beginning with a job as a technical consultant for Microsoft, that job saw me traveling all over the
            world to
            set up and support conferences. After that I did a bit of cyber security consulting for a major
            healthcare
            provider, HIPPA compliance and all that. That gig ended after a year or so which saw me head back into
            PC
            support as in a hybrid support/administration position. But I've always found myself more interested in
            programming and building things than just fixing them! My goal is to get a remote job as a software
            engineer
            where I am treated with respect and supported in my continued education.</p>
