About me
This is an about me guessing game. It uses HTML, JS, and CSS. It asks the user a series of questions about me, than displays different messages if they get the answer correct. Once the user is through all the questions, it displays my HTML about me page. Which contains a short autobiography.

- Reflections and Comments
  1. I seriously benefit from well structured pseudo code.
  2. CSS is very powerful, but tricky and picky.
  3. I used consts to remove the possibility of forced errors in the if else loops.
  4. JS does not have a native method to capitalize only the first letter of a string.
